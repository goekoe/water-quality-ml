# Water Quality Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a water sample is safe for drinking based on various water quality indicators using machine learning.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
- Features: pH, Hardness, Solids, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity
- Target: Potability (0 = not safe, 1 = safe)

## Workflow
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Random Forest model training
- Model evaluation

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
